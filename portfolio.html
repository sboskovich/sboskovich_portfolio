<p> This is a link to my first project on Scratch</p>
</a>
<p> During this project, I have learned many new programming techniques including how to switch a character's motion if a certain instance is true. Doing this project was very fun, as the decisions to make for different endings makes the story interactive and different almost every time. My code uses many different algorithms, including a few that can change the setting of the story at the click of a button. The code uses algorithms to hide characters in one story from another story, or vise versa. I have learned a few new coding tricks, including how patterns can make a cool effect, like as 1 character which has 2 different costumes can do movements such as squats. I had lots of fun programming the different stories with the motions of the characters. </p>
