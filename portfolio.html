<p> This is a link to my first project on Scratch</p>
</a>
<p> During this project, I have learned many new programming techniques including how to switch a character's motion if a certain instance is true,  Doing this project was very fun, as the decisions to make for different endings makes the story interactive and different almost every time. My code uses many different algorithms, including a few that can change the setting of the story at the click of a button. The code uses algorithms to hide characters in one story from another story, or vise versa. I have learned a few new coding tricks, including how patterns can make a cool effect, like as 1 character which has 2 different costumes can do movements such as squats. I had lots of fun programming the different stories with the motions of the characters. </p>

<p> This is a link to my first project on App Inventor!</p>
</a>
<p> During this project, my partner, Bradley, and I learned how to use MIT App Inventor to make a Western-themed two player deuling game. This game used block coding similar to Scratch, with more complex code blocks, to prepare us for structured languages. The code we used was able to have multiple screens, so we made a start/home screen, an introduction screen, a music menu, and the game screen itself. We used two cowboy characters as the different players, each one with a unique speed difference. The cowboys move up and down automatically, but the user can control when to fire their weapon at the other player. From this project, I really learned how to use the coordinant system better in coding and direction is everything. I also learned how to create a "barrier" around the screen, meaning if something were to hit it, the object would either bounce or disappear. This code uses many integers for position and speed, as well as algorithms that control the direction the cowboy faces. I had lots of fun testing out the program with others, and watching how the cowboys reacted to certain parts of the code.</p>

<p> This is my first Python Project!</p>
</a>
<p> During this project, my partner, John, and I had to create a periodic table quiz. This quiz, written entirely in Python, gave the user a choice between three quiz types, depending on how the user wished to be tested. The user can either start off with the name, atomic symbol, or atomic number, then has to find either the atomic number or the name. This code used lots of strings to instruct the user which how to answer each question and to even tell the user the question asked. The code uses integers to select a random element, atomic symbol, or atomic number. I had a lot of fun on this project learning the basic foundation for Python, as well as the new materials, including docstrings and loops. This project helped to develop me as a programmer because it forced me to not only understand the material and the language of Python, but how to form the code to the right pattern that would be able to function as a working Periodic Table Quiz. </p>

<p> This is a link to my Image Artist project! </p>
<p> For the Image Artist project, my partner, Austin, and I took the picture of a yellow labrador retriever off of the Internet. From there, we were able to write some code, manipulating the image. The colors of the dog changed, going from a golden yellow to a pink. In addition, we were able to rotate the picture 180 degrees so it was upside down and make the picture blurry. Finally, we were able to write a line of code that would save our new image to the same folder that the original picture was stored in. In this project, we learned that we are able to manipulate an image to our specific desire. In the code, we used        </p>
